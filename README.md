# RGC RogoBudrum is a Dungeon Crawler Based on the Templated provided in the Assets

##Description
RGC RogoBudrum is a Dungeon Crawler game, in the spirit of Eye of the Beholder,
which started off from the Dungeon Crawler in the Asset Library (Mar 2024).

## Art used by:
* Enemy Sprites #1: Eli Solowej @Tastygraph (Public Domain)
* Enemy Sprites #2: JosephSeraph (CCby3 license) -- https://opengameart.org/users/josephseraph
* I had bought the animated torches so they are not included on the repository version.
* Swords and Shields were in a ZIP with Public Domain icons. If you know the artist(s) let me know.
* Any other art is AI-generated.

## IT WAS NEVER COMPLETED. 
Currently the version includes only the warrior class (and no menu to pick the other classes).
The other classes would be: ranger/rogue, mage and cleric.
It also has no sound.

## Reason for not completing it
Believe it or not, when you create a game all by yourself it has to be a game that 
you LOVE playing as well. After around 300-400 times of rebooting it to test features
and balance things out, I got tired of it. Lesson learned.

## Why would you post online a half-finished source code?
1. It might help someone who hasn't even started (just like the example in Godot helped me)
2. Someone might like it and want to finish it with me (BUT it will be 100% free game if released)
